## New Classes
#### Protagonist
* Protagonist: The good guy, who you play as.
* God: For that carefree relaxed experience. OP stats, impossible to lose with.
* Healer: Instead of dealing damage for a specialized attack, will heal itself.
* Wizard: Has a large arsenal of spells with varying strengths. Pushes the boundaries of the physical world.
#### Monster
* Monster: The bad guy, who you fight (and hopefully beat).
* Doubler: Doubles damage done to you over time.
* Quizzer: Essentially a Sphinx, answer correctly and you get a free hit. Answer incorrectly, and... well you'll see.
* Wildcard: A bit... quirky. Hits with varying strengths.

## Versioning
* v0: The set up. Creating the basics where the generic Protagonist functions, and can fight the generic Monster.
* v1: Making Protagonist and Monster subclasses of Character.
* v2: Adding Doubler, Quizzer, Wildcard, and ReflectOChangeO as subclasses of Monster. Adding God, Healer, and Wizard as subclasses of Protagonist.
* v3: Adding `about()` to the subsubclasses.
* v4: Fixing the `about()` methods of the subsubclasses.
* v5: Correcting `specialize()` and `normalize()` so they don't force all protagonists to have the same stats.

## That far and shining horizon
* Allow protagonists to choose a team of protagonists, and allow the player to pick who attacks at each moment
* A larger variety of attacks - ~Spinning Thunder Kick!~ Long ranged attacks
* FIX REFLECTOCHANGO OUR CHILD :(

## New Classes
#### Protagonist
* Protagonist: The good guy, who you play as.
* God: For that carefree relaxed experience. OP stats, impossible to lose with.
* Healer: Instead of dealing damage for a specialized attack, will heal itself.
* Wizard: Has a large arsenal of spells with varying strengths. Pushes the boundaries of the physical world.
#### Monster
* Monster: The bad guy, who you fight (and hopefully beat).
* Doubler: Doubles damage done to you over time.
* Quizzer: Essentially a Sphinx, answer correctly and you get a free hit. Answer incorrectly, and... well you'll see.
* Wildcard: A bit... quirky. Hits with varying strengths.

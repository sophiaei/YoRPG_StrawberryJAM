- to get a "private" variable in an inherited class, we need to use "protected"
  - we tried both setting it to public and moving the variable declaration, but a deep trawl throuhg the API gave us this better METHODS
- found out that this() is calling a constructor on itself
- inheritables
  - needs a superclass (parent class)
  - subclasses can be instantiated with extends __CLASS__ keyword
  - methods + vars declared in superclass work for subclass

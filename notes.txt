L01: An Adventurer is You!

time spent: 8.0 hrs


* DISCO:
 - to get a "private" variable in an inherited class, we need to use "protected"
   - we tried both setting it to public and moving the variable declaration, but a deep trawl through the API gave us this better METHODS
 - found out that this() is calling a constructor on itself
 - inheritables
   - needs a superclass (parent class)
   - subclasses can be instantiated with extends __CLASS__ keyword
   - methods + vars declared in superclass work for subclass
 - You can redefine methods in subclasses
 - In the terminal `.` is self-referencial!! (type ls -a to see it),
   so typing cp -r path/./ resting/place will copy the *contents* of path/ to resting/place
   (intertrash assisted)
   can also do git add ./

* QCC:
- What is static? We had far too many issues such as calling a non-static method in a static context
- What on earth is wrong with Reflect-O Change-O?? It did not Reflect or Change-O :(
- Why did the smaug variable not update about()? We ended up having to call the individual monsters in each conditional.


Work for picking Archetypes
Picking archetypes:
  -Monsters
    -Wildcard: THE JOKER???
      -Random chance of hitting you
    -Doubler (better name later)
      -Doubles damage the longer they survive
    -Riddler (maybe)
    -Anti Healer (maybe)
    -Reflect-o Change-o
      -Swaps you and opponents attack/defense

  -Protagonist
    -Healer
      -specialized heals instead of damaging other
    -God
      -Wins.
    -Wizard
      -A little unreliable :P

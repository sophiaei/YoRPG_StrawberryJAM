- to get a "private" variable in an inherited class, we need to use "protected"
  - we tried both setting it to public and moving the variable declaration, but a deep trawl throuhg the API gave us this better METHODS
- found out that this() is calling a constructor on itself
- inheritables
  - needs a superclass (parent class)
  - subclasses can be instantiated with extends __CLASS__ keyword
  - methods + vars declared in superclass work for subclass

Picking archetypes:
  -Monsters
    -Wildcard: THE JOKER???
      -Random chance of hitting you
    -Doubler (better name later)
      -Doubles damage the longer they survive
    -Riddler (maybe)
    -Anti Healer (maybe)
    -Reflect-o Change-o
      -Swaps you and opponents attack/defense

  -Protagonist
    -Healer
      -specialized heals instead of damaging other
    -God
      -Wins.
    -Wizard
      -A little unreliable :P
